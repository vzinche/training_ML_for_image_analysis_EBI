        "PS: PyTorch already has quite a bunch of all possible data transforms, so if you need one, check [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html). The biggest problem with them is that they are clearly separated into transforms applied to PIL images (_remember, we initially load the images as PIL.Image?_) and Torch tensors (_remember, we converted the images into tensors by calling transforms.ToTensor()?_). This can be incredibly annoying if for some reason you might need to transorm your images to tensors before applying any other transforms or you don't want to use PIL library at all. "
